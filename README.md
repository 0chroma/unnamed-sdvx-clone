# hello-world
Trying to create a game based on [KShoot](http://kshoot.client.jp/)/[SDVX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBHKNl87juA).

Currently it supports loading maps made for kshoot which it loads by specifying the path to one in the command line.

Only tested to compile with Visual Studio 2015.
